# SQL script Project

Welcome to the this SQL script Project! This repository contains SQL snippets, scripts to generate random data, and Proof of Concepts (POCs).

## Project Overview

This project is designed to help developers and database administrators understand and implement security measures to protect their SQL Server environments. The repository contains POCs that demonstrate how to prevent common attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### Current Contents

At present, the project includes the following:

1. **POC-sql-injection.sql**  
   Location: `MSSQL-bluehat-hacking/POC-sql-injection.sql`  
   This script provides a step-by-step guide to demonstrating and preventing SQL injection attacks. It includes examples of vulnerable code, methods to exploit these vulnerabilities, and secure coding practices to prevent such attacks.

2. **POC-xss-attack.sql**  
   Location: `MSSQL-bluehat-hacking/POC-xss-attack.sql`  
   This script demonstrates a Proof of Concept for preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on a Microsoft SQL Server. The script includes vulnerable scenarios, methods of exploitation, and secure practices to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

## Project Structure

- **MSSQL-bluehat-hacking/**: This directory contains POC scripts related to preventing specific hacking attacks.
  - `POC-sql-injection.sql`: POC for SQL injection prevention.
  - `POC-xss-attack.sql`: POC for XSS attack prevention.

## Future Additions
This project is a work in progress, and future updates will include:

- More POC scripts for additional attack vectors.
- SQL snippets and scripts to generate random data for testing purposes.
- Enhanced documentation on security best practices for SQL Server environments.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the security scripts or want to add new POC examples, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.

## Disclaimer
These scripts are intended for educational purposes only. Use them responsibly and in a controlled environment. Do not use them on production servers without fully understanding the implications and potential risks.
